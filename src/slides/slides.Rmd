## We will learn

 1. How to access, query and obtain the data 
 
 2. Visualize and get them ready for further exploration and analyses   
 
 3. To use R packages: lwdataexplorer, eurobis, worrms, mregions, sdmpredictors

## Exercises of today


  1. Access marine regions data

  2. Get data from marine species from LifeWatch

  3. Get data from species in EurOBIS

  4. Access seabed habitat and human activities from EMODnetWFS  
  
  
## 1. Access marine regions data

mregions is an R package that contains a standard, relational list of geographic names, coupled with information and maps of the geographic location of these features.

## 2. Get data from marine species from LifeWatch

lwdataexplorer retrieves biodiversity, environmental or genetic data from the projects supported by LifeWatch Belgium, a virtual laboratory for biodiversity research

## 3. Get data from species in EurOBIS

EurOBIS is the package to get biogeographic data on marine species collected by European institutions and make it freely available and easily accessible.

## 4. Access seabed habitat and human activities from EMODnetWFS  

An R to query information on and download data from all available EMODnet Web Feature Service (WFS) endpoints (bathymetry, biology, chemistry, geology, human activities, physics, and seabed habitats) directly into their R working environment
